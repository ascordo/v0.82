#ifdef IRremote_h
#ifdef Ping_h

//This function does not belong to the Ping sensor, nor to the IRReceiver: It's
//a product of the relation between them and some boards. That's why it's a new
//library itself. It's a function to prevent an incompatibility between
//the IRReceiver and the Ping classes:
